# C_PlusPlus_Research

# Overview

I wrote a C++ file that uses variables and prints out `Hello World!`.

I have been working with some projects in Python that uses some syntax and concepts that are common with the C++ language and wanted to learn more about it. 

# Developmental Environment

I used VSCode to write my program. I installed the C/C++ extension to make sure that everything can compile correctly. 

# Useful Tools

- [W3Schools C++ Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp)

# Future Work 

- Implement lists/tuples with slicing.
